2)Indexing in SQL. advantages, disadvantages
3)restaurant DB design, create REST end points, how will you secure REST. e.g administrator / hotel staff different set of permissions
-followup question report to be generated daily at 9:30 PM to get orders in the whole day , their amount.Spring scheduler? what if instance/application is down how will you generate the report(Quartz tool or something he wanted to hear)
4)Docker runs only one linux? How is docker deployment different from VM deployments
5)Kafka architecture
6)if 2 consumers within same application have subsribed to kafka topic only one should consume how?
7)If two instances of application execute some logic and I want logic execution should not be done by other instance of one instance is alread running it - answered as DB table locks

SECOND ROUND
1)Explain your application architecture
2)I want to call SOAP service without UI code. How can I? Answer is use the tool SOAP UI
3)How do you authenticate/authorise SOAP calls
4)How do you authenticate/authorise REST calls? DIfference between token and key
